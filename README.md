This is a solo project done in the data science internship in Feynn Labs. 
It is the continuation of my 1st project in Feynn Labs internship .
Two datasets are used to get insights . 
Due to size constraint, one dataset could not be uploaded in the repository. The Dataset is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venkatramakrishnan/india-water-quality-data/data and then the work on "IndiaAffectedWaterQualityAreas.ipynb" is done.
Some recent statistics are used in the project directly from internet due to unavailability of raw dataset. 
The brief project article is uploaded in the pdf form.
